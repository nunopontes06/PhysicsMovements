This report was prepared within the scope of the Fundamentals of Physics course unit of the Computer Engineering course, taught at Universidade Lus√≥fona do Porto.
The general objectives of the work are to create a graphic environment/scenario to simulate discipline-specific physical movements. The project focuses on demonstrating three physical properties: MRUV, Horizontal Motion, and Springs and Slides.
The knowledge acquired in classes throughout the semester was put into practice.
As a development platform, PyCharm with the VPython module was chosen.
